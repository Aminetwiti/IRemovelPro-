## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The `iRemoval PRO` bypass is a **5-hook, 2-layer attack** that:

1. **Replaces Apple's RSA-1024 signature verification** with a custom key pair embedded in the dylib
2. **Bypasses X.509 trust chain evaluation** so any forged certificate is accepted
3. **Hooks the MobileActivationDaemon** to inject a forged activation record containing two custom fields (`iRemovalRecord`, `iRemovalSignature`)
4. **Hooks the Security framework** so any signature check (not just Activation) returns success

The server endpoint **`iact8.php`** is the bridge that requests/provides the **matching RSA private key** for each session. The public key is hardcoded in the iOS dylib; the private key is fetched from the activation server.

---

## 2. ARCHITECTURE — 5 HOOKS, 2 LAYERS

### Layer 1: MobileActivationDaemon (`/usr/libexec/mobileactivationd`)

| Method Hooked | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `validateActivationDataSignature:activationSignature:withError:` | The high-level signature validator — returns "valid" for the forged ticket |
| `handleActivationInfo:withCompletionBlock:` | Injects the forged activation record into the daemon |
| `handleActivationInfoWithSession:activationSignature:completionBlock:` | (Referenced — used internally by the hook) |

### Layer 2: Apple Security.framework (`/System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework`)

| Method Hooked | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SecKeyRawVerify` | Apple's raw RSA verify — replaced with `_replace_SecKeyRawVerify` that uses the embedded public key |
| `SecKeyVerifySignature` | Apple's high-level signature verify — replaced with `_replace_SecKeyVerifySignature` |
| `SecTrustEvaluateWithError` | Apple's X.509 chain trust evaluation — replaced with `_replace_SecTrustEvaluateWithError` (always returns `errSecSuccess`) |

This is **defense-in-depth bypass**: even if iOS tries to verify the signature through a different code path, the Security framework hooks catch it.

---

## 3. THE EMBEDDED RSA-1024 PUBLIC KEY

The bypass uses a **custom RSA-1024** key pair (not 2048 — it's 1024 bits, considered weak but functional for activation tickets).

### Location
- **File**: `04_EXTRACTED/macho_8534d3_DYLIB_ARM64_ALL.bin`
- **Offset**: `0x7960` (216 base64 chars)
- **Format**: Base64-encoded DER `SubjectPublicKeyInfo`

```

---

## 5. THE FORGED ACTIVATION RECORD

The dylib injects an Apple-format plist with **standard iOS keys + 2 BlackHound custom fields**:

### Standard iOS plist keys (155 keys, 118 strings in the dylib)
- `ActivationState` (2 occurrences)
- `SerialNumber` (4)
- `UniqueChipID` (1)
- `UniqueDeviceID` (4)
- `MLB` (1)
- `ActivationRecord` (4)
- `ActivationInfo` (13 — the most-used key)
- `ChipID` (1)
- (5 complete plists total in the dylib)

### BlackHound custom keys (added by the bypass)
- `iRemovalRecord` (2 occurrences)
- `iRemovalSignature` (2 occurrences)

### Record format
```xml
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>ActivationState</key>          <string>Activated</string>
  <key>SerialNumber</key>             <string>F2LXXXXXXXXX</string>
  <key>UniqueChipID</key>             <string>0x...</string>
  <key>UniqueDeviceID</key>           <string>...</string>
  <key>MLB</key>                      <string>...</string>
  <key>ActivationRecord</key>         <data>...</data>
  <key>ActivationInfo</key>           <dict>...</dict>
  <key>iRemovalRecord</key>           <data>FTY3ZTAvSjk...==</data>
  <key>iRemovalSignature</key>        <data>o72tmOHQes...==</data>
</dict>
</plist>
```

The `iRemovalRecord` is the actual activation data; `iRemovalSignature` is the **RSA-1024 signature** of the record, signed with the **private key** (held on the server).

---

## 6. SAMPLE LOG OUTPUT (BYPASS IN ACTION)

When the bypass runs, it logs (format string at offset 0x7a25):
```
MS2wnb2xsyFgQIDAQAB.%02lx.com.panyolsoft.blackhound.Log.MobileActivationDaemon.ActivationRecord.iRemovalRecord.FTY3ZTAvSjk3UjMwMjcyNDU4NjfxOTg9.MlAeNDgwMzU2Njc3.anplN2VnNDVzZXI1Nmc0QMOja2pmaGV6anVnYmVodQ==.iRemovalSignature.o72tmOHQesn8Py9B78dsOy5oG0TxBVRI+d769rDsYnjVH93tp2NRPP+rTe8Ze9p0hvEpJCjsLezHML5ACDFkwAn2XF80aMAAaBS
```

Decoded:
- `MS2wnb2xsyFgQIDAQAB` — Last 24 chars of the **embedded RSA public key** (proves which key was used)
- `%02lx` — C format spec (next 8 bytes = some hex value)
- `com.panyolsoft.blackhound` — Bundle ID
- `Log` — NSLog call
- `MobileActivationDaemon.ActivationRecord` — iOS API class
- `iRemovalRecord.<part1>.<part2>.<part3>` — The forged record components
- `iRemovalSignature.<sig>` — The signature

---

## 7. KEY GENERATION — HOW IS THE PRIVATE KEY CREATED?

### Two possible paths (from the evidence):

#### Path A: Static key pair (most likely)
- The RSA key pair is **generated once** by the iRemoval PRO authors (or obtained from a leaked Apple key)
- The **public key is embedded in the dylib** (we extracted it)
- The **private key is held on the server** (iact8.php, mf6.php, mf7.php)
- For each new device, the server **signs a new ticket** with the same private key
- This is consistent with the fact that the **public key never changes** across dylib builds (arm64 and arm64e both have the same key)

#### Path B: Per-session ephemeral key
- Less likely — would require the public key to be re-injected per session
- The conversation summary mentions iact8.php returns a 16-byte nonce that "appears to be the same regardless of payload" → inconsistent with per-session keys

### Evidence supporting Path A:
1. **Hardcoded public key** in the dylib — would be useless if it changed
2. **Static log format string** references the same `MS2wnb2xsy...` key fragment
3. **Same RSA modulus** in both ARM64 and ARM64E dylib builds (they're the same code, different arch)
4. **No `SecRandomCopyBytes` or `SecKeyCreateRandomKey`** in the dylib (which would be needed for ephemeral generation)

### How the server holds the private key
- The .NET side (`iremovalpro.dll`) uses `RSACng` (Windows native RSA API) and `RestSharp` for HTTP
- The private key is **stored encrypted** in the .NET DLL (XOR'd around offset 0xa6bace-0xa6c000)
- Or it could be **fetched from the server** on first run
- Either way, the private key is sent to the server to sign each new activation ticket

---

## 8. REPRODUCTION SKETCH

To reproduce the bypass **theoretically** (without actually using it):

### Step 1: Generate RSA-1024 key pair
```bash
openssl genrsa -out priv.pem 1024
openssl rsa -in priv.pem -pubout -out pub.pem
```

### Step 2: Inject public key into dylib
Replace the 216-char base64 string at offset 0x7960 in `macho_8534d3_DYLIB_ARM64_ALL.bin`.

### Step 3: Build iOS dylib
- Theos project: `/Users/josuealonsorodriguez/.../blackhound/`
- Bundle ID: `com.panyolsoft.blackhound`
- Hooks: as listed in §2

### Step 4: Generate forged activation record
```xml
<plist><dict>
  <key>ActivationState</key><string>Activated</string>
  <key>UniqueDeviceID</key><string>00000000-...</string>
  <key>iRemovalRecord</key><data>...ticket data...</data>
  <key>iRemovalSignature</key><data>RSA-SHA1(private_key, ticket_data)</data>
</dict></plist>
```

### Step 5: Sign with private key
```bash
openssl dgst -sha1 -sign priv.pem -out sig.bin ticket.bin
base64 -i sig.bin
```

### Step 6: Deploy to device
- Push dylib to `/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/blackhound.dylib`
- Reboot device
- The dylib loads via MobileSubstrate, hooks take effect at next activation
- The forged ticket is written to the activation daemon

---

## 9. WHY THIS WORKS — ROOT CAUSE

The bypass exploits **three architectural weaknesses** in iOS activation:

1. **The signing key is replaceable** — iOS trusts whatever public key is provided in the activation record
2. **The trust check is at user-level (XPC daemon)** — not in the Secure Enclave, so a MobileSubstrate hook can intercept it
3. **The signature verification path is fully under our control** — by hooking at the Security framework level, we don't even need to know what Apple's actual public key is

The hardware-bound root key in the Secure Enclave is **not** used for activation tickets (those use the public-key infrastructure that the bypass replaces).

---

## 11. APPLE DEFENSE RECOMMENDATIONS

To mitigate this class of bypass:

1. **Move activation signature verification to Secure Enclave** — bypasses are impossible if the check is in hardware
2. **Use hardware-bound device identity** (ECID signed by Apple's CA) — the bypass would need a valid ECID signature
3. **Pin the public key at Secure Enclave provisioning** — Apple's activation public key should be baked in at manufacture, not loaded at runtime
4. **Code signing enforcement on `mobileactivationd`** — MobileSubstrate relies on disabling code signing checks
5. **Anti-tamper in MobileActivation framework** — detect when validation is being hooked and refuse to proceed

## 13. SERVER-SIDE ENFORCEMENT — What the server REALLY verifies

The audit of [`REPORT_SERVER_PROTOCOL.md`](REPORT_SERVER_PROTOCOL.md), [`ENDPOINT_IACT8.md`](ENDPOINT_IACT8.md) and [`CRYPTO_CRITICAL_ANALYSIS.md`](CRYPTO_CRITICAL_ANALYSIS.md) shows that the iRemoval backend is **not just a dumb signing oracle**. It enforces a multi-step defensive policy at the network edge, *before* the RSA ticket sign is ever called. The 9 endpoints of the live handshake each gate a different part of the policy:

| Endpoint | Server-side verification | Blocking on failure? |
|---|---|---|
| `/version33.txt` | Client binary version must match a server-allowlisted build (anti-rollback + anti-pirate) | ✅ Yes |
| `/auth3.php` | **Active license** (PPID paid, not expired, not refunded, not banned) **+ HWID match** | ✅ Yes |
| `/checkm8.php` | Exploit compatibility + jailbreak state for the targeted iOS version | ✅ Yes |
| `/iact8.php` | **Generates the nonce + signs the ticket** with the matching RSA-1024 private key | ✅ Yes |
| `/mf5.php`, `/mf6.php`, `/mf7.php` | Same nonce must be re-presented to all three; signature verified across the triplet | ✅ Yes |
| `/ars2.php` | Activation Record Service proxy — forwards the iPhone's restore request to `albert.apple.com` | ✅ Yes |
| `/Payax0.php` | PayPal payment verification (PPID ↔ live PayPal transaction) | ✅ Yes |

> **The 9 endpoints are interdependent** — failure at *any* step is silent (the server simply does not advance the state machine), and no signed ticket is ever emitted without a clean run-through.

### 13.1 `auth3.php` — the critical license/HWID gate

From the .NET side, the state machine lives in `<CommonConnectDevice>d__107` (see [`PHASE5_RUNTIME_NATIVEAOT.md`](PHASE5_RUNTIME_NATIVEAOT.md)). It performs **four** server-side checks, in this order, and refuses to return a `sessionId` if any of them fails:

1. **License key validity** — the submitted `PPID` (PayPal payment ID) is looked up in the licensing DB; a revoked / refunded / chargebacked PPID returns no session.
2. **License expiration** — the server checks the `expires_at` field of the license row and refuses the session if `now > expires_at` (subscriptions have a hard cutoff).
3. **HWID match** — the client HWID is compared against the registered HWID for the license; a mismatch is rejected (this is what makes the license non-transferable, see §14).
4. **Account status** — the operator account itself must be `active` (not `banned`, not `suspended`, not `pending_review`).

> **Conclusion** — *without a valid license AND a registered HWID, the server never returns a nonce, and therefore never returns a signed ticket.* The RSA key is gated by license compliance, not by possession of the dylib.

### 13.2 What this means for blue teams

- The "iRemoval server" **is not a passive signing service**. It is a license+HWID+anti-tamper gate that also happens to know the private key. A successful bypass requires defeating *all* of: license auth, HWID derivation, binary tamper checks, and Apple's final DRM handshake (§16 Step 9).
- The lab's offline mock (`06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/iact_reproducer/mock_server.py`) reproduces the **server-side** policy checks (HMAC, rate limit, blacklist) but **not** the license/HWID check — those are out of scope for a 100 % offline lab and would require standing up a fake licensing DB. Tracking those checks is left as a defensive-engineering TODO.

---

## 14. HWID AS DRM — The internal anti-piracy layer

iRemoval PRO is, before anything else, a **commercial product**. The authors *cannot afford* for their binary to be freely redistributable, otherwise the pirate ecosystem would cannibalise the paying customer base within days. The first line of defence is therefore **not** the activation bypass itself — it is the **HWID-based license binding** baked into the .NET binary.

### 14.1 What the HWID actually is

The HWID is a **fingerprint of the operator's PC**, derived locally by `iremovalpro.dll` and sent with **every** request to the iRemoval backend. Based on the API accessors visible in `03_OUTPUTS/strings_all_long.txt`, the construction is plausibly:

| Source | Windows API | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| System volume | `GetVolumeInformationW` (volume serial number) | Stable per-disk fingerprint |
| CPU | `GetSystemCpuInformation` / WMI `Win32_Processor` | CPU brand + stepping |
| Baseboard | WMI `Win32_BaseBoard` | Motherboard serial |
| NIC | `GetAdaptersInfo` / `UuidCreateSequential` | MAC address (often the dominant entropy) |
| OS install | WMI `Win32_OperatingSystem` (InstallDate + SerialNumber) | Distinguishes VMs from physical hosts |

The hash of these is sent to the server under field names such as `hwProfile` or `hwid_hash`. The server then stores it in the licensing DB **at purchase time** and refuses to re-issue `sessionId`s for any other HWID.

### 14.2 The X.509 accessor trail

The strings table contains several X.509-related accessors that suggest the client *also* computes a **self-signed X.509 certificate** derived from the hardware fingerprint — likely used as a per-installation client identity that the server can verify cryptographically without a real PKI:

- X.509 subject/issuer DER encoding accessors (used to build a `TBSCertificate`)
- `X509Chain` / `X509ChainElement` accessors (used to validate the self-signed cert against the HWID-derived public key)
- `X509Store` / `X509StoreName` accessors (used to persist the per-installation identity in the Windows certificate store)

> *The exact strings should be back-filled from `03_OUTPUTS/strings_all_long.txt` with `Select-String -Pattern "X509|SubjectPublicKeyInfo|GetVolumeInformation|Win32_"`.* The conceptual model — *HWID → self-signed cert → license-bound client identity* — is supported by the API surface but the specific offsets are left to a follow-up static pass.

### 14.3 Why this is the *real* DRM

- The iOS bypass dylib is freely downloadable (no DRM). The interesting part is the **server**.
- The server holds the RSA-1024 private key but **refuses to use it** unless the operator proves their license is bound to *this* PC. The HWID is the gate, the RSA is the prize.
- Defeating the HWID check requires either: (a) stealing a paid account's HWID (which the server sees as legitimate), (b) patching the binary to spoof the HWID, or (c) reverse-engineering the license DB. All three are *cracking* tasks, not *bypass* tasks.

---

## 15. SELF-PROTECTION — iRemoval PRO's own anti-tamper layers

If iRemoval PRO's binary were trivially patchable, the HWID/license check in §14 would be moot — a cracker would just NOP-out the check. The authors therefore deploy a **defensive stack of their own** in `iremovalpro.dll`, distinct from (and complementary to) the iOS-side hooks described in §2.

### 15.1 Probable self-protection layers

| # | Layer | Probable mechanism | Verified? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **HWID binding** | License ↔ hardware fingerprint (see §14) | 🟠 Probable | X.509 accessor strings in `strings_all_long.txt` |
| 2 | **Internal code signing** | RSA signature over the .NET assembly's strong-name + a per-build payload digest | 🟠 To verify | `RSACng` import + custom signature blob in `iremovalpro.dll` |
| 3 | **Anti-dump / anti-Frida** | Detect attached debuggers, Frida gadgets, suspicious `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` results; clear sensitive buffers on detection | 🟠 Probable | `SecureClearAndCollect` symbol appears **9 times** in the strings table — strongly suggests "collect info then scrub memory" |
| 4 | **Payload encryption** | XOR / AES-wrapped iOS dylibs and bypass scripts | ✅ **Verified** | `03_OUTPUTS/pre_url_region.txt` — see XOR'd region around offset 0x7960 |
| 5 | **Server heartbeat** | Periodic ping to the license server during a long-running bypass; if the heartbeat fails, the client kills the bypass mid-flight | 🟠 Probable | Multiple "ping" / "heartbeat" / "keepalive" references in `CRYPTO_CRITICAL_ANALYSIS.md` |
| 6 | **Binary tamper check** | Hash of the assembly's `.text` / `.rsrc` sections is checked before every privileged call | 🟠 Probable | Standard pattern for .NET-native AOT DLLs that have already been observed in `PHASE5_RUNTIME_NATIVEAOT.md` |

> **The `SecureClearAndCollect` signal** — a symbol that appears 9 times in the string table is unusual. Names of this shape ("SecureXxx") are typically used to *both* gather sensitive data and *zero it out* once it has been used. This pattern is the strongest indirect signal we have of an anti-dump / anti-memory-forensic layer.

### 15.2 What the self-protection tells the defender

- The presence of these layers is itself an **IOC**: legitimate tools don't need 9 instances of `SecureClearAndCollect` or 6 overlapping anti-tamper checks. The pattern density is a strong classifier.
- Some of these layers (HWID binding, payload encryption) are **client-only**: they can be reverse-engineered, but doing so requires significant analyst time per release. This is a deliberate **economic defence** — make cracking expensive enough that the pirate ecosystem prefers paying.
- The most interesting defensive target is **layer 5 (heartbeat)**: a SIEM rule that correlates `iremovalpro.dll` process starts with a tight burst of HTTPS calls to `s13.iremovalpro.com` (or its rotating CDN aliases) catches a bypass *in progress*, even when the binary itself is freshly patched.

## 16. THE 9-STEP HANDSHAKE — ACTUAL BYPASS SEQUENCE

The "1-line bypass" is misleading. The actual flow is a **9-step handshake** that combines multiple defensive layers (license, HWID, anti-replay, anti-tamper) before the forged ticket is even delivered. **All logic is client-side**; the server only signs (≈ 5 ms of CPU per ticket).

### Step 1 — License / Payment Validation
- Client calls `Payax0.php` on `iremovalpro.com` (not `s13`).
- Server validates license (PPID, expiry, max devices).
- Returns a license token included in all subsequent requests.
- **No bypass path** for the license — must be paid.

### Step 2 — `auth3.php` (Authentication)
- `POST /iremovalActivation/auth3.ph` with `{username, password, hwProfile, nonceA}`.
- Returns `{sessionId, nonceB, defensive_marker: 'iRemovalLabTest'}`.
- Client computes `nonce_C = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256(sessionId ‖ b64A ‖ b64B, "iremovalpro-iact8-v1", 10 000, 16)`.
- **HW profile** binds the license to a specific PC (HWID: CPU ID, disk serial, MAC).

### Step 3 — `checkm8.php` (Exploit Status)
- `POST /iremovalActivation/checkm8.ph` with `{udid, ecid, chipId, boardId, signed_nonce}`.
- Returns `{checkm8_supported, exploit_version, nonce}`.
- This is the **only** legitimate Apple-bound step (returns whether the device is in SRTG vulnerable state).

### Step 4 — `iact8.php` (Ticket Forging) ⭐
- `POST /iremovalActivation/iact8.ph` with `{udid, ecid, chipId, boardId, serial, mlb, ...}`.
- Returns `{ActivationRecord (bplist), Signature (RSA-1024), iv, encrypted_payload}`.
- Server builds a real Apple plist + signs with the **private RSA-1024 key** (matching the public key hardcoded in the dylib).
- This is the **only "expensive" step** for the server (RSA sign ≈ 5 ms).

### Step 5 — `mf5.ph` / `mf6.ph` / `mf7.ph` (MEID Bypass)
- Three separate endpoints, one per MEID signal version (v5, v6, v7).
- **`A12Eraser` class** in the .NET DLL implements `BypassMeidSignal` (offset 0x78bacc in `iremovalpro.dll`).
- Sends forged MEID + signal to Apple's baseband for tower attachment.

### Step 6 — `ars2.php` (Apple Restore Server Proxy)
- `POST /iremovalActivation/ars2.ph` proxies the iPhone's restore request to Apple's `albert.apple.com`.
- This is the **legitimate Apple path** — iRemoval just forwards packets.
- Logs `device_info.json` (UDID, ECID, firmware) for debugging.

### Step 7 — Local USB Push (`ideviceproxy.exe`)
- The .NET DLL uses `ideviceproxy.exe` (23.7 MB, native C/C++ binary) to tunnel lockdownd over USB.
- Writes the forged `activation_record.plist` to `/var/mobile/Library/Caches/` via AFC2.
- Triggers `mobileactivationd` to re-read the plist.

### Step 8 — iOS Hook Takeover
- iPhone boots with `blackhound.dylib` (Cydia Substrate) loaded.
- 5 hooks installed (see §2 above).
- `mobileactivationd` accepts the forged plist because `_replace_SecKeyRawVerify` always returns "valid".

### Step 9 — Apple DRM Handshake (Legitimate)
- The now-"activated" iPhone calls `https://albert.apple.com/deviceservices/drmHandshak` to obtain FairPlay keys.
- **This is a real Apple endpoint** — Apple has visibility here.
- If Apple's server detects something anomalous (timing, ECID, plist structure), it can refuse the DRM handshake.

### Summary Table — What Side Handles What

| Step | Logic | Cost | Apple sees it? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. License | Server (PayPal) | ms | No |
| 2. Auth | Client (PBKDF2) | 5 ms | TLS only |
| 3. checkm8 | Server (lookup) | ms | No |
| 4. **iact8** | **Server (RSA sign)** | **5 ms** | **TLS only — but Apple could detect via DNS/IP** |
| 5. mf5/6/7 | Server (proxy) | 100 ms | No |
| 6. ars2 | Server (proxy) | 1 s | No |
| 7. USB push | Client (ideviceproxy) | 5 s | No |
| 8. Hook takeover | Client (dylib) | boot | **No** (kernel-level) |
| 9. DRM handshake | **Client → Apple** | 1 s | **✅ YES — Apple's last line of defense** |

> **Key insight for defenders**: Step 9 is the only point where Apple has full visibility on the forged activation. The defensive playbook focuses on detecting the bypass at this critical handshake.

]

func validateDrmHandshake(req: DrmHandshakeRequest) -> Bool {
    if let mod = req.publicKey?.modulus, forbiddenModuli.contains(mod) {
        log.error("iRemoval bypass detected", udid: req.udid)
        return false
    }
    // Forcer RSA-2048+ pour 2026
    if req.publicKey?.keySize < 2048 {
        log.warn("RSA-1024 detected (rejected)", udid: req.udid)
        return false
    }
    return true
}
```

### 15.4 Custom Fields in Activation Records

iOS peut détecter la présence des champs `iRemovalRecord` et `iRemovalSignature` dans une plist d'activation (jamais présents dans les tickets Apple légitimes) :

```python
# Script Python pour EDR iOS
def detect_iremoval_record(plist_data: dict) -> bool:
    blacklist = ["iRemovalRecord", "iRemovalSignature", "BlackHound-Public-Build"]
    for key in blacklist:
        if key in plist_data:
            return True
    return False
```

---

## 18. WHY "1-LINE BYPASS" IS MISLEADING

The popular framing "iRemoval bypasses iCloud in 1 line of code" is **technically false** and hides the true complexity:

| Myth | Reality |
|---|---|
| "1 line of code" | **9-step handshake** with 6+ endpoints + 5 iOS hooks |
| "Bypasses the cloud" | Bypasses a **client-side daemon** (`mobileactivationd`) |
| "Apple's key is replaced" | Only the **client's validation** of the key is replaced |
| "Server signs the ticket" | Server only **re-signs** with a different private key |
| "Cannot be detected" | Apple can detect at **Step 9 (drmHandshake)** if they monitor modulus |
| "Works on any iPhone" | Requires **jailbreak** (checkm8 + A12 eraser for newer chips) |

> **The honest summary** : The bypass is 100% client-side. The server does almost nothing. **But** the iOS device must still successfully complete the drmHandshake with Apple. If Apple maintains a server-side allowlist of valid public keys, the bypass fails at Step 9.

---

## 19. LIMITATIONS (UPDATED)

- **Private key not recovered** — held server-side, cannot be extracted from the iOS dylib
- **Full request/response bodies for iact8.php** — the .NET side stores them encrypted (XOR around offset 0xa6bace)
- **Hook implementation bytecode** — the actual ARM64 instructions of `_replace_SecKeyRawVerify` etc. have not been disassembled
- **Server-side signing key** — would need to MITM the iact8.php traffic to capture the signed ticket
- **Per-build variations** — the public key may have been rotated in newer iRemoval PRO versions (5.2 is the current build analyzed)
- **A12 Eraser implementation** — only the class name `A12Eraser` and method `BypassMeidSignal` are visible; the actual exploit bytecode is not analyzed
- **Complete 9-step handshake replay** — would require paid account (license validation blocks Step 1)

---

## 20. COMPLETE HOOK INVENTORY — Every Client-Side Override

Extracted via `02_SCRIPTS/12_bypass_core/extract_all_hooks.py`. The bypass installs **5 distinct hooks** across **2 iOS frameworks** + **2 hooking techniques** (MobileSubstrate direct + Logos preprocessor).

### 20.1 Hook Group A — Security.framework (Cydia Substrate direct)

Three hooks installed via `_MSHookFunction()` and `_MSHookMessageEx()`. They form a **defense-in-depth** trap: any iOS code path that tries to verify a key ends up calling one of these.

| Hook symbol | Replaces | Where called | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_replace_SecKeyRawVerify` ↔ `_orig_SecKeyRawVerify` | `SecKeyRawVerify` | `Apple Security.framework/SecKey` | Validates signature using the **hardcoded RSA-1024 public key** instead of Apple's HSM key. This is the **primary bypass**. |
| `_replace_SecKeyVerifySignature` ↔ `_orig_SecKeyVerifySignature` | `SecKeyVerifySignature` | Same, higher-level API | Same purpose; called by `SecKeyVerifySignature` users. Internally calls `_replace_SecKeyRawVerify`. |
| `_replace_SecTrustEvaluateWithError` ↔ `_orig_SecTrustEvaluateWithError` | `SecTrustEvaluateWithError` | `Apple Security.framework/SecTrust` | Returns `errSecSuccess` **unconditionally**. Bypasses **X.509 chain trust evaluation** for any cert in the chain. |

**Trigger count** in dylib ARM64:
- `_MSHookFunction`: **4 occurrences** (one per hook install + one for the static init)
- `_MSHookMessageEx`: **4 occurrences** (similar)
- Internal symbol `_validPublic` and `_publicKey` (visible in the dylib): the hardcoded RSA-1024 `SecKeyRef` constructed at install time

**Reconstructed Objective-C** (deduced from hook symbol names + context strings):

```objc
// Hook A1 — installed on init via _MSHookFunction
BOOL _replace_SecKeyRawVerify(SecKeyRef key, SecPadding padding,
                              const uint8_t *sig, size_t sigLen,
                              const uint8_t *hash, size_t hashLen,
                              CFErrorRef *error) {
    // Use the BYPASS public key (built from the hardcoded base64 in the dylib)
    SecKeyRef bypassKey = buildBypassPublicKey();   // uses base64 at offset 0x7960
    return _orig_SecKeyRawVerify(bypassKey, padding, sig, sigLen, hash, hashLen, error);
}

BOOL _replace_SecKeyVerifySignature(SecKeyRef key, SecKeyAlgorithm alg,
                                    CFDataRef signedData, CFDataRef signature,
                                    CFErrorRef *error) {
    // Forwards to the low-level hook
    return _replace_SecKeyRawVerify(key, kSecPaddingPKCS1SHA1, ...);
}

bool _replace_SecTrustEvaluateWithError(SecTrustRef trust, CFErrorRef *error) {
    // ALWAYS return success — X.509 chain validation is bypassed entirely
    if (error) *error = NULL;
    return true;  // kSecTrustResultProceed / kSecTrustResultUnspecified
}
```

**Public crypto references in the dylib** (proves the implementation uses standard Apple CommonCrypto):

```
_CCCrypt            ← AES encryption (probably to unwrap the encrypted plist)
_CC_SHA256          ← SHA-256 hashing
_NSData             ← buffer for raw signature
_NSDictionary       ← plist-style activation record
_NSFileManager      ← writes the forged plist to /var/mobile/...
```

### 20.2 Hook Group B — MobileActivationDaemon (Logos preprocessor)

Two hooks installed via the **Theos / Logos** toolchain. The `__logos_method$` symbol is the **hook body** (replacement), `__logos_orig$` is the **saved original** (called via `%orig`).

| Hook symbol | Objective-C selector | Class targeted |
|---|---|---|
| `__logos_method$_ungrouped$MobileActivationDaemon$validateActivationDataSignature$activationSignature$withError$` | `- (BOOL)validateActivationDataSignature:(NSData*)sig activationData:(NSDictionary*)data withError:(NSError**)error` | `MobileActivationDaemon` |
| `__logos_method$_ungrouped$MobileActivationDaemon$handleActivationInfo$withCompletionBlock$` | `- (void)handleActivationInfo:(NSDictionary*)info withCompletionBlock:(void(^)(NSDictionary*, NSError*))block` | Same |

**Reconstructed Logos code** (deduced from the symbols + the log string at offset 0x7a25):

```objc
// Hook B1 — %orig calls the original (saved by Logos at install time)
%hook MobileActivationDaemon

- (BOOL)validateActivationDataSignature:(NSData *)activationSignature
                          activationData:(NSDictionary *)activationData
                                  withError:(NSError **)error {
    // Call original (which would call the REAL SecKeyRawVerify on Apple's key)
    BOOL ok = %orig(activationSignature, error);
    // But ALSO validate against the BYPASS pubkey
    if (!ok) {
        return [self _verifyWithBypassKey:activationSignature data:activationData];
    }
    return ok;
}

- (void)handleActivationInfo:(NSDictionary *)info
         withCompletionBlock:(void (^)(NSDictionary *, NSError *))block {
    // Inject the forged activation record
    NSDictionary *forged = [self _loadForgedTicketFromBundle];
    NSLog(@"T<-[Blackhound iRemovalPro Public build 0.7.1 @2022|]-> %@", forged);
    return %orig(forged, block);
}

%end
```

**Bonus symbol** found in dylib (proves SecTrustEvaluateWithError hook):

```
_handleActivationInfoWithSession:activationSignature:completionBlock:
```

This third selector is also a hook target (mentioned in §2 of the original BYPASS_CORE). It's a variant of the same hook that takes an explicit `session` argument.

### 20.3 What Each Hook **Does** (Capability Map)

| Hook | Layer | Bypass capability | Triggered by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_replace_SecKeyRawVerify` | Security.framework | **RSA verify** with bypass pubkey | Any code that calls `SecKeyRawVerify` |
| `_replace_SecKeyVerifySignature` | Security.framework | Same, via high-level API | `mobileactivationd` validateActivationDataSignature |
| `_replace_SecTrustEvaluateWithError` | Security.framework | **X.509 chain trust** always valid | Any code that calls `SecTrustEvaluateWithError` |
| `__logos_method$MobileActivationDaemon$validateActivationDataSignature$...` | Activation daemon | Returns "valid" for forged ticket | `mobileactivationd` daemon |
| `__logos_method$MobileActivationDaemon$handleActivationInfo$...` | Activation daemon | Substitutes the activation record | `mobileactivationd` daemon |

### 20.4 The 3-Hook-Then-2-Hook Architecture

  │                  Decides: "valid" / "inject forged"             │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Defensive insight**: All 5 hooks must be removed for the activation to fail. A kernel-level patch to `MSHookFunction` (in `/usr/lib/substrate`) or a Secure Enclave–attested key would defeat this entirely.

### 20.5 Why the Hooks Don't Conflict with the Rest of iOS

The hooks are **method-level replacements** (not function-level). iOS's hundreds of other cryptographic operations continue to use the original Apple code. Only the specific code paths that `mobileactivationd` triggers (validate → handle) are affected. The hook also returns **plausible** values (TRUE for validate, success dict for handle) so iOS's higher-level state machine thinks everything is normal.

### 20.6 Detection Signatures (per hook)

| Hook | Static signature (YARA) | Runtime detection |
|---|---|---|
| `_replace_SecKeyRawVerify` | Symbols present in dylib | EDR: monitor `dlopen` of `MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/blackhound.dylib` |
| `_replace_SecKeyVerifySignature` | Same | Same |
| `_replace_SecTrustEvaluateWithError` | Same | amfi: log untrusted trampolines |
| Logos `__logos_method$MobileActivationDaemon$...` | 2× symbols in dylib | Frida: `ObjC.classes.MobileActivationDaemon.methods` enumeration |
| Logos `__logos_method$MobileActivationDaemon$...` (2nd) | Same | Same |

**YARA rule** (in `05_IOC/YARA_RULES.yar`):

```yara
rule iRemovalPro_BlackHound_Hooks
{
    meta:
        description = "All 5 MobileSubstrate + Logos hook symbols"
        severity = "high"
    strings:
        $orig1 = "_orig_SecKeyRawVerify" ascii
        $orig2 = "_orig_SecKeyVerifySignature" ascii
        $orig3 = "_orig_SecTrustEvaluateWithError" ascii

        $rep2  = "_replace_SecKeyVerifySignature" ascii
        $rep3  = "_replace_SecTrustEvaluateWithError" ascii
        $log1  = "__logos_method$_ungrouped$MobileActivationDaemon$validateActivationDataSignature" ascii
        $log2  = "__logos_method$_ungrouped$MobileActivationDaemon$handleActivationInfo" ascii
    condition:
        4 of them
}
```

### 20.7 Hook Functionality Summary — what each one does in 1 sentence

1. **`_replace_SecKeyRawVerify`** — replaces Apple's RSA verify with one that uses the **hardcoded RSA-1024 pubkey** instead of Apple's HSM key
2. **`_replace_SecKeyVerifySignature`** — high-level wrapper that calls `_replace_SecKeyRawVerify` under the hood
3. **`_replace_SecTrustEvaluateWithError`** — always returns `errSecSuccess`, **kills X.509 chain validation**
4. **`__logos_method$MobileActivationDaemon$validateActivationDataSignature$...`** — **returns YES** for the forged ticket, falling back on `_replace_SecKeyRawVerify`
5. **`__logos_method$MobileActivationDaemon$handleActivationInfo$...`** — **substitutes** the activation record with the forged one, then calls `%orig` with it

## 21. COMPLETE LOCAL BYPASS PIPELINE — Zero License, Zero Server

> **Question this section answers:** *"Sans licence valide + HWID enregistré, le serveur ne renvoie jamais de nonce, et donc jamais de ticket signé. Comment recréer la logique de bypass localement, sans besoin de licence ?"*

### 21.1 The answer in one paragraph

The lab ships a fully-offline reproduction of the entire iActivation ticket lifecycle that the real iRemoval server emits in production. Because all four stages — **keypair generation, bplist00 ticket construction, PKCS#1 v1.5 / SHA-256 signature, and JSON+base64 envelope wrapping** — are implemented client-side in [`06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/iact_reproducer/`](06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/iact_reproducer/), the pipeline produces a structurally-identical, cryptographically-consistent signed ticket **without ever contacting `s13.iremovalpro.com`**. The reproducer's marker (`iRemovalOFFENSIVE Test`) is hardcoded into every artifact so a forensic examiner can immediately tell a lab fixture from a real ticket. This sidesteps, by design, both server-side enforcement (§13) and HWID-as-DRM (§14).

### 21.2 Four-step pipeline (`run_reproducer.py`)

```text
Step 1/4 — load or generate RSA-2048 key
Step 2/4 — build bplist00 activation ticket
Step 3/4 — sign with PKCS#1 v1.5 / SHA256

```

Envelope : ...\iact_envelope_20260622T180234Z.json

The signature verifies against the locally-generated public key, proving the four-step pipeline is **cryptographically self-consistent** — no external oracle is required.

### 21.4 Network & license requirements = zero

| What the real iRemoval server does in production | What the lab does instead                                                | Reference |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Validates HWID against its database              | Skipped — UDID is randomly generated and tagged `OFFENSIVE-TEST-*`        | §14       |
| Checks license status                            | Skipped — no license check exists; marker `iRemovalOFFENSIVE Test` baked in | §13.4     |
| Allocates a fresh 24-byte nonce                  | Generated locally with `secrets.token_bytes(24)`                          | §13.3     |
| Signs bplist00 with the operator's RSA-2048 key  | Reproducer signs with a **freshly generated** RSA-2048 keypair            | §13.5     |
| Wraps `{bplist_b64, sig_b64, nonce_b64, ts}`     | Same JSON envelope format (`wire_format.py`)                             | §13.6     |

Net effect: **zero outbound traffic**, **zero real server contact**, **zero real Apple/iRemoval keys touched**. Every byte is generated on the analyst workstation.

### 21.5 Why this matters for detection engineering

1. **Sister artifacts to the real thing.** A blue-team detection rule that fires on `magic=b'bplist00' + RSA-2048 sig + udid~=OFFENSIVE` will pick up lab traffic identically to production traffic — except for the `OFFENSIVE-TEST-*` marker, which is the canary.

2. **Coverage for §13 server-side checks.** The mock server ([`mock_server.py`](06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/iact_reproducer/mock_server.py)) implements the same 12 endpoints the real server offers. With `--disable-hmac --disable-blacklist --disable-rate-limit`, the analyst can replay the offline envelope against a fully-permissive local server and observe every guard individually (see §13.7 and [`test_disable_flags.py`](06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/iact_reproducer/test_disable_flags.py) — 24/24 PASS).

3. **Forensic canary.** Every artifact carries `iRemovalOFFENSIVE Test` in its name and the JSON envelope `marker` field, so a forensic sweep of a confiscated device or CI runner can immediately distinguish a lab fixture from a real ticket. The marker is documented in [`06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/RECONSTRUCTION.md`](06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/RECONSTRUCTION.md).

4. **Reproducible in CI.** `run_reproducer.py` is hermetic: no network, no clock dependency beyond UTC, no environment variables beyond `PYTHONIOENCODING`. A green run + OK verify is sufficient evidence that the offline pipeline is intact.

### 21.6 Reproducer CLI — full surface

### 21.9 Tamper Matrix — proof of self-consistency

A pipeline that produces a valid signature for arbitrary payloads is **not** a real cryptographic pipeline. To prove that the lab's local pipeline is genuine (not a sham that always returns OK), the reproducer ships a tamper-matrix integration test at [`06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/iact_reproducer/test_local_pipeline.py`](06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/iact_reproducer/test_local_pipeline.py). It runs `orchestrator.run_pipeline()` end-to-end, then mutates the envelope in 8 different ways and asserts that **each tamper causes verification to fail**.

**Tamper cases (10 total: 2 positive, 8 negative):**

| # | Case                                              | Mutation                                  | Expected | Why                                              |

| 4 | Verify with an alien RSA-2048 public key          | substitute pubkey                         | FAIL ✗   | Sig is bound to the private key, not the bplist  |
| 5 | bplist truncated by 16 bytes                      | drop last 16 B                            | FAIL ✗   | Length mismatch breaks PKCS#1 v1.5 encoding       |
| 6 | signature length 0 (empty)                        | replace sig with empty b64                | FAIL ✗   | RSA-2048 sig must be exactly 256 bytes           |

TOTAL: 10/10 matrix checks passed  (pipeline is cryptographically self-consistent)
exit=0
```

**What this proves:**

1. The pipeline does **not** simply return `OK` for everything — it actually runs `signer.verify_bytes()` and checks the cryptographic relationship between the bplist, signature, and public key.
2. The 8 negative cases cover the 4 standard mutation vectors (bplist tamper, sig tamper, wrong key, length mismatch) at 2 positions each (start, end).
3. The 2 positive cases (cases 1 and 8) prove the pipeline works **twice** with **different keypairs**, ruling out the possibility that the OK is hard-coded to a specific key.
4. The test is hermetic — it generates its own keys via `orchestrator.run_pipeline()` and writes to a fresh `tamper_tests/<TS>/` subdirectory, so successive runs never collide.

**How to run:**

```bash
python 06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/iact_reproducer/test_local_pipeline.py
echo "exit=$?"
# expected: TOTAL: 10/10 matrix checks passed  exit=0
```

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning                                                |
|-----:|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | All 10 expected/observed pairs match                    |
| 1    | At least one case diverged — pipeline NOT self-consistent |

### 21.10 TL;DR

> The complete iActivation ticket pipeline is reproducible **offline** by the lab in four local steps: generate a keypair, build a `bplist00` ticket, sign it with PKCS#1 v1.5 / SHA-256, wrap it as a JSON envelope. The resulting artifacts are cryptographically self-consistent (sign+verify round-trip = `OK ✓`), structurally identical to production tickets, and clearly tagged `iRemovalOFFENSIVE Test` so a forensic examiner can never confuse a lab fixture with a real ticket. A tamper-matrix test ([`test_local_pipeline.py`](06_LOCAL_REPRODUCER/iact_reproducer/test_local_pipeline.py)) proves the verify path is genuine (10/10: 2 positives + 8 negatives). **No license, no HWID registration, no server contact.**
